      <h2>Color Tuner</h2>
      <p>
      The <i>Color Tuner</i> is a design tool that allows you to see, and select, accessible foreground
        and background colors by calculating and displaying the contrast ratio for colors as well
        as modifying foreground and background colors to meet accessibilityguidelines for luminance
        contrast (WCAG 2.1, Guideline 1.4, Success Criterion 1.4.3 and Success Criterion 1.4.6).

      <h2>Color Matrix</h2>
      <p>
        Along with the Color Tuner, the Color Matrix allows you to evaluate the contrast of an entire
        palette at one time.

      <h2>Readability</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>Readability</i> utility calculates the <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i> for content. The
        <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i>, or <i>LIX</i>, was developed by Carl-Hugo Björnsson in the late 1960s,
        nearly a decade prior to the readability tests primarily used in the US that were developed by
        <span aria-label="doctors">Drs.</span> Flesch and Kincaid. Unlike the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests,
        i.e., the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> and the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>, the <i>LIX</i> is not
        tied to a single language by using a syllable count to determine word complexity - the <i>LIX</i> uses
        word <em>length</em> to determine word complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason this is important can be demonstrated by examining two short sentences - one in English
        and the other in Spanish - "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina" and passing them through
        the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> test and the <i>LIX</i> to see if the readability scores are significantly
        different or close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both phrases, "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina", are three words in one sentence and,
        using the <i>LIX</i> measure, each contains one <em>complex</em> word. Where they differ significantly,
        however, is in the syllable count - the English phrase contains five syllables and the Spanish phrase
        contains eight. When we compute the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> for these phrases, we get a score of
        <strong><em>62.9</em></strong> for the English phrase and a score of <span aria-label="negative">-</span>21.8
        for the Spanish phrase. Their <i>LIX</i> scores, however, are both 36.3.
      </p>
      <p>
        The higher the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score, and the lower a <i>LIX</i> score, the easier text is to
        read. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score that falls between 60 and 70, as the score for the English phrase
        does, <em>should</em> correspond to a eigth or ninth grade reading level. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score
        that falls between 0 and 30, which is still <em>much</em> higher than the score for the Spanish phrase,
        <em>should</em> correspond to a college graduate reading level and is considered very difficult to read. A
        <i>LIX</i> score of 50, on the other hand, <em>should</em> correspond to a first or second grade reading
        level.
      </p>

      <h3>Caveats</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>There are jurisdictions in which a maximum <em>reading grade level</em> is established for
          content.</strong> The <i>LIX</i> <em>cannot</em> be used in those situations, you
          <strong><em>must</em></strong> use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>. There have not been an
          adequate number of samples used to determine if there is a relationship between the <i>LIX</i> and
          reading grade level, so if reading grade level is important in your consideration, it is recommended
          that you use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i> and note that its results apply <em>only</em> to
          English text.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The current version of the <i>Readability</i> object does not account well for phrases that are not
          complete sentences, so some measure of caution should be used. For example, the phrase "Last Name"
          would have a <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i> score of 2, but the the phrase "Surname" would have a
          <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i> score of 101, even though its complexity would not <em>ordinarily</em> be
          considered that much greater. I am currently working to determine how best to accommodate this to improve
          the tool's handling for forms where this is a significant issue.
